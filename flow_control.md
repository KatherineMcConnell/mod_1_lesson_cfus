# Flow Control

## Check for Understanding

#### What will the following code print to the screen?

```
  play_again = true
  lives = 3

  if lives == 0
    puts "You Lose!"
  elsif !play_again
    puts "Game Over!"
  elsif play_again && lives > 0
    puts "Welcome back!"
  else
    puts "invalid input"
  end
```

  * "Welcome back!"

#### What values would play_again and lives need to be assigned to in order to print each of the following to your terminal:

  * “You Lose!” if Lives = 0
  * “Game Over!” if Play_Again = false
  * “Welcome back!” if play_again = true and lives is greater than 0
  * “Invalid input if any of the above conditions are not met.

#### Using times, while, until and loop, print “Beetlejuice” to the terminal 3 times. 🐝
